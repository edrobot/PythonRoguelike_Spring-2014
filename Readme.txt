This program was compiled on a 64-bit, Windows 8 PC using Python 2.7.4., and libtcod 1.5.1

The Libtcod graphics library is windows only, so it will NOT run on a mac. However, the pathfinding and State Machine code should work on any operating system. And while the library has it's own implimentation of A*, this project only only the graphics drawing functions; the AStar functions used are not Libtcod's implimentations.

INSTALLATION:
First, install Pyton 2.7.4. Then, extract all of the files in this ZIP to a folder of your choice. After that, run the "Main.py" file. There are many ways to do this, but the simplest is to double-click the file. Then the game should appear in just a moment.

Note that if you are using an IDE (such as IDLE or Pyscript), the program may crash when you attempt to close it. This is a known bug with Libtcod 1.5.1., and you can safely close the program using the task manager.
